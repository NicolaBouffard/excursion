### Project Objective

- To further gain skill using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Command line**, **Git** and **GitHub**.

### Project Tasks

- Create a new repository in github and link it to local directory.
- Initiat git in local directory using the command line.

- Add/commit/push as often as necessary.
- Link html to style.css.
- Creat new directories to store image and video data for html document.
- Create css linked to html using a visual guide.

- Add/commit/push as often as necessary.

### Problems I faced and how I resolved them

- Videos & images would not load on GitHub Pages but would work locally. I promtly realised that i hadd to add/commit/push the new files within my images/videos directories.
- I tried to add style.css from the directory I was currently in and came accross an error message 
 **fatal: pathspec 'style.css' did not match any files**.
I changed to the correct directory and tried again. After I finished the project, I learnt I could  git add from a diffent directory if I specify the correct path.
- I forgot how to correctly start a HTML document. I went through my old notes and quickly discovered the correct layout. 
- I had a few typos that I corrected.
    
### What I learnt 

- How to open files using the "open" command.
- How to git add from a different directory.

### What needs to be improved

- How to start and make html documents more effectively.
- Discovering new commands and knowing when to use existing command knowledge for better efficiency
